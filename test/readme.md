## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<b>
```powershell
.\Action-UpdateDNSJson.ps1 -Install -DCIpAddr 192.168.2.6
```
</b>

##### Arguments explanation
- <b>Install</b> (Boolean): This argument is meant to automate the initial deployment of the script on the Hyper-V host. This flag will trigger the following actions:
  - Disable the existing <B>Action-UpdateDHCPDNS</B> scheduled task
  - Create a new scheduled task to run the <B>Action-UpdateDNSJson.ps1</B> at the system boot
  - Reconfigure the DHCP Scopes lease duration to 12 hours, set both "<b>006 DNS Servers</b>" and "<b>042 Time Servers</b>" options with the domain controller IP Address (see: <b>DCIpAddr</b>). Default value: <b>false</b>
- <b>DCIpAddr</b> (String): Specifies the IP Address for the domain controller. Default value: <b>192.168.2.6</b>

Next copy the <b>Action-UpdateDNSFowarders.ps1</b> script into your Domain controller
<b>
```powershell
.\Action-UpdateDNSFowarders.ps1 -Install
```
